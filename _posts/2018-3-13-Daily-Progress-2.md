Because we got another opportunity, i got my hand full of jobs at our ongoing project, [PreMe](https://preme.id).

Because my teamates that work on admin got to handle new project, For this week my backlog are, i must continue admin page for Preme with angular 2 and material http://tomastrajan.github.io/angular-ngrx-material-starter/ , 

Because my teamates already created the core (that was what i thought) i plan to create a generator with following this tutorial
https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-interactive-command-line-application-with-nodejs and https://medium.com/northcoders/creating-a-project-generator-with-node-29e13b3cd309

I was very excited that i created "jarvis" that will generate all stacks that i've learned so far until i got to read the code that my teamates create. wow.. the core is not really finish.. hmm

OKAY ... wait for me jarvis .. need to code some angular code first..
